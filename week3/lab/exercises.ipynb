    "<font color=red>**Reminder:** In most of the upcoming problems you will be asked to write functions with their names being indicated in the problem. It is very important to use exactly the names provided (for example, `myfunction()`) as you will be able to reuse your functions in future exercises and also because our in-class tests are automatically graded. If you do not use the exact name as required (for example using `myFunction()`) your function will not be executable and you will lose marks. Also, when asked to write functions, make it a habit to write a function `main()` where all the testing is done. This `main()` function should define meaningful input parameters, call the functions, and output the result for testing. \n",
