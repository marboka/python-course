    "## Introduction\n",
    "The aim of this coursework is to code a Python 3 module `stocktrader` that allows the user to load historical financial data and to simulate the buying and selling of shares on the stock market. *Shares* represent a fraction of ownership in a company and the total of all shares form the *stock* of that company. Shares can be bought and sold on the stock market at a price that varies daily. A reasonable investor aims to buy cheap shares and sells them when the price is higher. The actions of buying and selling shares are referred to as *transactions*. Transactions usually incur *transaction fees*, but we will not consider these in this project."

    "\n",
    "### What can/cannot be used for this coursework? \n",
    "The Python knowledge contained in the lecture notes is essentially sufficient to complete this project. While you are allowed to consult the web for getting ideas about how to solve a specific problem, the most straightforward solution may already be in the lecture notes. You are also allowed to use online sources, but you must clearly indicate copy-and-pasted code like so: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "   # the following 3 lines follow a similar code on \n",
    "   # http://webaddress.org/somecode.htm as retrieved on 24/04/2018\n",

    "Let’s be clear about what is *not* allowed:\n",

    "<font color=red>You are NOT allowed to send, give, or receive Python code to/from classmates and others.</font> \n",

    "\n",
    "This project is the equivalent of a standard exam and it counts 70% towards your final mark. Consequently, the standard examination rules apply to this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your Python module is submitted via the Blackboard system, it will undergo plagiarism tests: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The turn-it-in system automatically checks for similarities in the codes among all students (without syntactical comparisons).\n",
    "2. Your lecturer compares the syntax of all submitted codes (interestingly, with the help of another Python program). Hence, refrain from communicating any code with others. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\" style=\"font-weight:bold\">\n",
    "Note that even if you are the originator of the work (and not the one who copied), the University Guidelines Plagiarism and Academic Malpractice (link below) require that you will be equally responsible for this case of academic malpractice and may lose all marks on the coursework (or even be assigned 0 marks for the overall course).\n",

    "\n",
    "### How is this coursework assessed? \n",
    "There are several factors that enter the assessment:\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, it will be checked whether you have followed the tasks and format specified below, using the prescribed function names, variable names, and data structures.\n",
    "* Second, your module will be tested manually by performing a number of predefined transactions, loading/saving a couple of portfolios, and testing trading strategies.\n",
    "* Further, all module functions will be tested automatically by another Python program (so-called unit testing). This is why it is important that your module \"does not do anything\" when it is imported into another program, and that you strictly follow the format of the functions specified in the tasks below (otherwise some of the tests may fail and you may lose marks).\n",
    "* It is also checked whether each function/line of code is free of bugs and the program runs without crashing. Functionality will be the main factor in the assessment.\n",
    "* It will be tested if your functions react to exceptional inputs in an appropriate manner (using Exceptions). It should be impossible to crash the code.\n",
    "* Make sure that your module is properly documented, and that all functions have meaningful docstrings. In particular, each function must explain its own inputs and returned values so that there is no room for misinterpretation. \n",
    "* Further marks will be given on the code efficiency and strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "### When and how to submit the coursework?\n",
    "The coursework can be completed and submitted as a single Python module named `stocktrader.py`. The submission is via Blackboard and **the strict deadline is Thursday, May 10th, at 1pm.** You can resubmit your coursework as often as you like, but only the last submission counts. **Submissions after the deadline will not be accepted.**"

    "The module `stocktrader` uses three essential data structures as explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `stocks` dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "The dictionary `stocks` stores historic financial data that your module can work with. The data for `stocks` is located in the `stockdata` subfolder, with each file of the form `SYMBOL.csv` corresponding to a particular company. Every entry in the `stocks` dictionary is a key-value pair. Each key is a string corresponding to a symbol and the value is again a dictionary. \n",

    "    '2012-01-05' : [430.472992, 430.472992, 417.273010, 418.364014],\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `portfolio` dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "`portfolio` is a dictionary that represents our capital at a given date. Our capital is the combination of cash and the shares that you hold. The keys in `portfolio` are strings `date`, `cash`, and arbitrarily many symbols. The respective values are the date of the last transaction performed on the portfolio in the form `YYYY-MM-DD`, the cash amount as a floating point number, and the integer number of shares held for each symbol. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a valid portfolio dictionary:\n",
    "```\n",
    "portfolio = { \n",
    "    'date' : '2013-11-27',\n",
    "    'cash' : 12400.45,\n",
    "    'EZJ' : 10\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpretation of this is as follows: on the 27th of November 2013 we have £12,400.45 in cash and we own 10 shares of easyJet. We could now look up in the `stocks` dictionary that the *low price* of easyJet on that day is £1426.00. Hence, if we sold all 10 easyJet shares on this day, we'd have £12,400.45 + 10 x £1426.00 = £26,660.45 of cash and no more `EZJ` shares. In this case the `portfolio` dictionary would only have two keys, `date` and `cash`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `transactions` list\n",
    "\n",
    "`transactions` is a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary corresponding to a buy/sell transaction on our portfolio. Here is an example of a valid transactions list:\n",
    "```\n",
    "transactions = [ \n",
    "    { 'date' : '2013-08-11', 'symbol' : 'SKY', 'volume' : -5 }, \n",
    "    { 'date' : '2013-08-21', 'symbol' : 'EZJ', 'volume' : 10 } \n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpretation of this is as follows: on 11th of August 2013 we **sold** 5 shares of Sky (because `volume` is negative), and on the 21st of August 2013 we **bought** 10 shares of easyJet (because `volume` is positive). The value of `volume` is always an integer, and the `date` values are chronological: while there can be two or more neighboring list entries in `transactions` having the same date, the following ones can never have an earlier date. This makes sense as the time order of transactions is important."

The function should accept the following input formats: `2012-01-09`, `2012/01/09` and `09.01.2012`, or any variant where the month and/or day are given without the leading `0`.

    "* `tradeStrategy2(verbose)` is not restricted to a single buying or selling transaction per day, and even allowed to buy and sell shares of a stock on the same day (which would however incur a loss because buying is at the daily high price, and selling at the low price)\n",
    "* `tradeStrategy2(verbose)` should not use any \"randomness\", i.e., two calls to the function with exactly the same data should result in an indentical list of transactions\n",
