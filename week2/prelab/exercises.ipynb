    "Here are some problems to be solved as an exercise. While you are welcome to use anything that comes in standard Python distributions, you are also strongly encouraged to use only what we have learned so far. Overcomplicating can often lead to errors or too slow programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem sheet we provide some test data for you to test your programs with. In future, these will not be provided. You should always analyze the problems at hand and find some data for testing. A few random values are always a good choice, as well as those from the *boundary cases* (highly dependent on the problem itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "Creative thinking and/or Googling might be required to solve some of these problems. However, none of them require knowlege of any material beyond what we have already covered. Please ask for help if you fail to solve problems on your own! "

    "* Remember that the algorithm from the lectures removes digits from a number, so using that number as a terminating condition of the loop has to be done carefully.
