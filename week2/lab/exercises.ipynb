    "1. Verifying the input means checking that $0 \\le d \\le 9$ and that $a > b \\ge 0$. There is no need to check that any of the loaded numbers are integers. This will be handled by the `int` funtion that crashes the program if something other than integer is given.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Checking that a certain number is a perfect square is not very hard, but there can be far too many candidates. For example, if $n = 1024 = 32^2$, there are only $33$ perfect squares in the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$, but we would have to check all $1025$ nonnegative integers smaller than or equal to $n$.  \n",
    "   A better approach is to loop through the possible values of $y$ (from zero to $\\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor$), compute $x = y^2$, and then check the conditions 3 and 4."
